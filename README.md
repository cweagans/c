# c

`c` is a quick way to jump to a project's directory from anywhere. This code
was taken almost verbatim from @holman's dotfiles (https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/blob/master/functions/c).

## Usage

If you're using zgen:

```
zgen load cweagans/c
```

If you're using something else that's not documented here, please open a pull
request to add the appropriate line to the readme.

Optionally, you can set the `$PROJECTS` environment variable to whereever you
prefer to keep your code. The default is `~/Code`.

Pull requests welcome, especially for new jump destinations (i.e. more than just
~/Code/* and $GOPATH/src/github.com/*.
